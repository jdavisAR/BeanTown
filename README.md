## üöÄ Overview

Basic List/Detail's app for efficiently loading and displaying Jelly Beans fetched from the open-source Jelly Belly Wiki API. This app is built with Jetpack Compose and uses modern MVI/MVVM archictecture.

## ‚ú® Features

* Jelly Beans are efficiently loaded from the Jelly Bean Wiki using **Ktor** in pages using **Paging3** then displayed in a `LazyColumn`.
* Jelly Beans are cached locally using **Room**.
* Jelly Images are asynchronsouly loaded using **Coil**
* The `lightVibrant` colors are extracted from Jelly Bean images using **Palette** to add vibrancy to the UI.
* All Viewmodels, Repository and Networking components are injected using **Koin**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Kotlin (2.1.21)**
* **Jetpack Compose (BOM: 2025.06.01):**
* **Coil (3.2.0):**
* **Jetpack Pallete library (1.0.0)**
* **Jetpack Room Persistence library (2.7.2)**
* **Jetpack Paging 3 library (3.3.6)**
* **Ktor (3.1.2)**
* **Koin (4.1.0)**

### Note

The Jelly Bean Wiki API appears to enter a hibernation/low power mode, potentially to cut back on operating cost, and API hits are delayed while the backend spins back up (_This is my theory based on usage; as this is undocumentated behavior_). This should only be an issue for the first page fetch as the paging library runs them one after another. Aubsequent pages will be fetched under ‚âà 200 ms. Since, the app caches Jelly Beans for an hour in a local database this shouldn't be much of an issue in practice.
